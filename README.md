# Predict HIV Progression With LSTMS
We are going to try to predict the likelihood that an HIV patient's infection will become less severe, given a small dataset and limited clinical information.

We achieve around 66% accuracy on the train set on a very small dataset (less than 1000 entries) by using multiple LSTM Neural Networks.
